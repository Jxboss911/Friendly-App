### Description 

Friendly App is a messaging platform that allows users to create personalized profiles and chat with each other. It offers a streamlined experience similar to iMessage, but with added features like user authentication and Firebase integration for secure data storage. The app uses authorization to ensure that users can create accounts, log in, and maintain privacy, while Firebase handles the database for real-time messaging and profile management. It's a simple, efficient way to connect and communicate with others.
